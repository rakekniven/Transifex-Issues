# Transifex-Issues

At the moment Transifex do not offer an open discussion platform or public issue tracker. That's why I created this repo.

As a power user I discovered some issues and have ideas to improve Transifex service.

My main project is Nextcloud, the Open Source Cloud solution. All ideas and issues are related to its community work.

Feel free to add more issues. Independant from Nextcloud.

Hello @Transifex: These repo should help you to improve your service. Please see issues as constructive contribution and not as general criticism.
