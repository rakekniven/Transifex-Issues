# Transifex-Issues

There is a powerful translation service named Transifex. The company offers its service for free for Open Source projects.

At the moment Transifex do not offer an open discussion platform or public issue tracker. That's why I created this repo.

As a power user I discovered some issues and have ideas to improve Transifex service.

My main hobby project is Nextcloud, the Open Source private cloud solution. All ideas and issues are related to its community work.

Feel free to add more issues. Independant from Nextcloud.

Hello @Transifex: These repo should help you to improve your service. Please see issues as constructive contribution and not as general criticism.
